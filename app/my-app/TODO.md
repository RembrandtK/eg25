# TODO: Election Voting App - Critical Issues & Next Steps

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES - BLOCKING PRODUCTION**

### **1. PRIORITY 1: Ranking Persistence on App Reload**
- **Issue**: When user reloads app, their submitted ranking is not displayed
- **Current State**: App always starts with empty ranking, even if user has voted
- **Expected**: App should read user's current ranking from smart contract on load
- **Implementation**:
  - Read directly from smart contract (not via server)
  - Call `getUserRanking(address)` on app initialization in `usePeerRanking` hook
  - Display existing ranking in UI if found
  - Allow user to modify and resubmit if desired
- **Impact**: Users lose track of their voting state, poor UX
- **Note**: This is the main blocker preventing users from seeing their vote persisted

### **2. Contract Reading Reliability**
- **Issue**: Contract reading functions may not be consistently working
- **Symptoms**: Rankings may not load properly from blockchain
- **Need**: Robust error handling and retry logic for contract reads
- **Implementation**: Add proper loading states and error recovery

### **3. Transaction State Management**
- **Issue**: No clear indication of transaction status after submission
- **Need**: Better feedback on transaction confirmation
- **Implementation**: Track transaction status and show confirmation

### **4. Error Handling & User Feedback**
- **Issue**: Limited error handling for edge cases
- **Need**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery flows
- **Examples**: Network failures, contract errors, World ID issues

## üöß **Minor Improvements & Polish**

### **Priority 1: UI/UX Enhancements**
- **Status**: Low priority, core functionality working
- **Potential Improvements**:
  - Add loading states for better user feedback
  - Improve error messages and user guidance
  - Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
  - Enhance mobile responsiveness

### **Priority 2: Performance Optimizations**
- **Status**: Optional, app performs well currently
- **Potential Improvements**:
  - Optimize contract reading frequency
  - Add caching for candidate data
  - Reduce unnecessary re-renders
  - Implement proper error boundaries

### **Priority 3: Additional Features**
- **Status**: Future enhancements
- **Ideas**:
  - Multiple election support
  - Advanced ranking analytics
  - Export ranking data
  - Social sharing features

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Fix Critical Ranking Persistence (URGENT)**
- [ ] Implement `getUserRanking` call on app initialization
- [ ] Display existing ranking in UI when found
- [ ] Handle case where user has no previous ranking
- [ ] Add loading state while fetching ranking data
- [ ] Test ranking persistence across app reloads

### **Phase 2: Improve Contract Reading Reliability**
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed contract reads
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for network issues
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for RPC failures
- [ ] Optimize contract reading performance

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Transaction Feedback**
- [ ] Track transaction status after submission
- [ ] Show transaction confirmation to user
- [ ] Handle transaction failures gracefully
- [ ] Add transaction history/receipt display

### **Phase 4: Production Readiness**
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Security audit and testing

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Contract Testing**
```bash
# Test contract deployment
cast code $CONTRACT_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Test function calls
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getUserRanking(address)" $USER_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getTotalRankers()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Test with different RPC endpoints
```

### **API Testing**
```bash
# Test voting status API
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/voting-status?action=overview"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/voting-status?action=user-ranking&address=0x3c6c2348d430996285672346258afb8528086d5a"
```

### **MiniKit Testing**
- Test in World App simulator
- Test with real World App on mobile
- Verify action handler registration in browser console

## üìù **Technical Notes**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Using viem for contract interactions
- MiniKit for World App integration
- Session-based wallet connection caching (working)
- World ID verification per ranking submission (working)
- Direct contract reading (not via server APIs)

### **Current Flow Status**
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection: Works, cached in session
- ‚úÖ World ID verification: Works, triggers on ranking submission
- ‚úÖ Transaction submission: Works, contract whitelisted
- ‚ùå Ranking persistence: Missing - app doesn't read existing rankings on load

### **Key Requirements for Production**
- [ ] Rankings must persist across app reloads
- [ ] Reliable contract reading with error handling
- [ ] Clear transaction status feedback
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness and performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit and testing
