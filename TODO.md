# Voting App Migration & Enhancement ‚Äî Election + ElectionManager Integration

MUST:

1. Keep updating this file with latest plans and tasks to work from.
2. Regularly commit and push changes being made.
3. Keep design doc of approach that evolves and is referenced.
4. Keep going on resolving issues.

## üéØ Project Overview

**MIGRATION COMPLETE**: PeerRanking contract removed, all functionality consolidated into Election + ElectionManager contracts.

**NEW REQUIREMENTS**: Full election lifecycle management where users can:

1. **Create Elections**: Set up new elections with candidates and World ID actions
2. **Vote with Rankings**: Submit ranked votes with World ID verification
3. **Trigger Selection**: Server-based selection calculation and reporting
4. **View Results**: Display election results and analytics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Current Smart Contracts (UPDATED)

- **ElectionManager.sol** deployed to worldchain-sepolia: `0xAA75C772ca977F89125B3592355346b9eFD37AC9`
- **Election.sol** instances created by ElectionManager for each election
- 4 test candidates: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Wilson

### Contract Capabilities (CONFIRMED)

- **Election Creation**: ElectionManager creates separate Election contracts
- **World ID Verification**: Proper ZK proof verification per vote
- **Ranking Storage**: RankingEntry[] with tie support
- **Selection Reporting**: Reporter role can trigger and store results

## üö® **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: REGULAR COMMITS**

**MUST commit and push changes regularly throughout development!**

- After completing each task or significant change
- Before switching between major components
- At least every 30 minutes of active development
