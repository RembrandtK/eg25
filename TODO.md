# Election Mini App - Development TODO

## üéØ Project Overview

Transform the existing TUTE token claiming Mini App into an election voting system where users can:

1. View candidates from a smart contract
2. Rank candidates in order of preference
3. Submit ranked votes using World ID verification

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Smart Contract Development

- [x] Created `ElectionManager.sol` with candidate management and ranked voting
- [x] Added World ID verification integration
- [x] Implemented candidate CRUD operations
- [x] Added ranked voting functionality with validation
- [x] Deployed contract to worldchain-sepolia: `0x53c9a3D5B28593734d6945Fb8F54C9f3dDb48fC7`
- [x] Updated Hardhat config to use `worldchain-sepolia` network name
- [x] Added deployment script with pnpm support

### Frontend Components

- [x] Created `CandidateList.tsx` - displays candidates from smart contract
- [x] Created `CandidateRanking.tsx` - drag-and-drop interface for ranking
- [x] Created `VoteButton.tsx` - submits ranked votes to contract
- [x] Updated main `page.tsx` to use election interface
- [x] Generated `election-abi.ts` with contract ABI and address
- [x] Fixed TypeScript issues with readonly ABI arrays

### Infrastructure

- [x] Updated package.json with election deployment script
- [x] Set up git workflow with regular commits
- [x] Created comprehensive contract tests for isolated validation
- [x] Added frontend integration simulation tests

## üöß Current Issues

### High Priority

1. ‚úÖ **Initial Candidates Added**: Verified 4 candidates are in the contract (Alice, Bob, Carol, David)
2. **Frontend Testing Required**: Need to test the complete voting flow end-to-end
3. **Contract Integration**: Verify frontend can load candidates and submit votes

### Medium Priority

1. **UI Polish**: Drag-and-drop could be enhanced with better visual feedback
2. **Error Handling**: Need better error messages for contract interactions
3. **Loading States**: Improve loading indicators during blockchain operations

## üìã Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours)

1. ‚úÖ **Add Initial Candidates to Contract**
   - [x] Check if candidates were added during deployment
   - [x] Create script to add candidates if missing
   - [x] Add 4 test candidates: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Wilson
   - [ ] Verify candidates appear in the UI

2. **Test Complete Voting Flow**
   - [ ] Test wallet connection
   - [ ] Test World ID verification
   - [ ] Test candidate loading from contract
   - [ ] Test ranking interface
   - [ ] Test vote submission
   - [ ] Test post-vote state (showing "already voted")

3. ‚úÖ **Contract Testing**
   - [x] Create comprehensive contract unit tests
   - [x] Create frontend integration simulation tests
   - [x] Validate contract functionality works as expected
   - [x] Test error scenarios and edge cases

4. **Fix Any Critical Bugs**
   - [ ] Debug any contract interaction issues
   - [ ] Fix TypeScript errors if any
   - [ ] Ensure proper error handling

5. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - [ ] Add better loading states
   - [ ] Improve drag-and-drop visual feedback
   - [ ] Add vote confirmation dialog
   - [ ] Show transaction hash after voting
   - [ ] Add candidate photos/avatars (optional)

6. **Enhanced Features**
   - [ ] Add vote viewing (if user has voted, show their ranking)
   - [ ] Add total vote count display
   - [ ] Add voting deadline functionality
   - [ ] Add admin panel for adding candidates

7. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Write unit tests for components
   - [ ] Test on different devices/browsers
   - [ ] Test with multiple users
   - [ ] Verify gas costs are reasonable

8. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Results visualization after voting ends
   - [ ] Multiple election support
   - [ ] Candidate profiles with descriptions
   - [ ] Vote delegation features
   - [ ] Integration with World ID groups

## üîß Technical Debt

- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all contract types
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Optimize contract calls (caching, batching)
- [ ] Add proper environment variable management

## üêõ Known Issues

1. ‚úÖ ~~Contract deployment parameters for initial candidates may not have been processed~~ - RESOLVED
2. Need to verify World ID verification works with the deployed contract
3. Drag-and-drop interface needs better mobile support
4. Test processes hanging during Hardhat test execution (needs investigation)

## üìù Notes

- Contract address: `0x53c9a3D5B28593734d6945Fb8F54C9f3dDb48fC7`
- Network: worldchain-sepolia (Chain ID: 4801)
- World ID App ID: `app_10719845a0977ef63ebe8eb9edb890ad`
- Using pnpm for package management
- Following World Mini App standards and components

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can connect wallet and verify with World ID
- [ ] Users can see list of candidates from smart contract
- [ ] Users can drag-and-drop to rank candidates
- [ ] Users can submit votes that are recorded on-chain
- [ ] Users see confirmation after voting
- [ ] Users cannot vote twice
- [ ] App works on mobile devices in World App
