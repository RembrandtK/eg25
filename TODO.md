# Election Mini App - Development TODO

## üéØ Project Overview

Transform the existing TUTE token claiming Mini App into an election voting system where users can:

1. View candidates from a smart contract
2. Rank candidates in order of preference
3. Submit ranked votes using World ID verification

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### üéØ Major Milestones Achieved

- **Smart Contract Deployed**: ElectionManager successfully deployed to worldchain-sepolia
- **Candidates Populated**: 4 test candidates added and verified
- **Frontend Components Built**: Complete voting interface with ranking system
- **Integration Validated**: Contract accessible from frontend with all functions working
- **Tests Created**: Comprehensive test suite for contract validation
- **Fast Feedback Loop**: Debug panel and testing scripts for rapid development

### Smart Contract Development

- [x] Created `ElectionManager.sol` with candidate management and ranked voting
- [x] Added World ID verification integration
- [x] Implemented candidate CRUD operations
- [x] Added ranked voting functionality with validation
- [x] Deployed contract to worldchain-sepolia: `0x53c9a3D5B28593734d6945Fb8F54C9f3dDb48fC7`
- [x] Updated Hardhat config to use `worldchain-sepolia` network name
- [x] Added deployment script with pnpm support

### Frontend Components

- [x] Created `CandidateList.tsx` - displays candidates from smart contract
- [x] Created `CandidateRanking.tsx` - drag-and-drop interface for ranking
- [x] Created `VoteButton.tsx` - submits ranked votes to contract
- [x] Updated main `page.tsx` to use election interface
- [x] Generated `election-abi.ts` with contract ABI and address
- [x] Fixed TypeScript issues with readonly ABI arrays

### Infrastructure

- [x] Updated package.json with election deployment script
- [x] Set up git workflow with regular commits
- [x] Created comprehensive contract tests for isolated validation
- [x] Added frontend integration simulation tests

## üöß Current Issues

### High Priority

1. ‚úÖ **Initial Candidates Added**: Verified 4 candidates are in the contract (Alice, Bob, Carol, David)
2. ‚úÖ **Network Configuration Fixed**: Frontend now connects to correct worldchain-sepolia network
3. ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Maximum Update Depth Exceeded Error**: Still occurring in World App despite multiple fix attempts
   - Error: "Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render."
   - Shows as "1 issue pill" in World App bottom-left corner
   - Candidates load correctly but infinite loop continues in background
   - Attempted fixes: Memoizing ABI, fixing useEffect dependencies, memoizing callbacks - none resolved issue
   - **NEEDS FRESH DEBUGGING APPROACH**
4. **Remove Redundant Wallet Connection Step**: App still shows wallet connection UI from original TUTE template
5. **Update App Branding**: Clean up titles, descriptions to reflect Election Voting app (not TUTE claiming)
6. **Frontend Testing Required**: Need to test the complete voting flow end-to-end
7. **Contract Integration**: Verify frontend can load candidates and submit votes properly

### Medium Priority

1. **Clean Up App Branding & UI**:
   - [ ] Remove TUTE-related text and replace with Election terminology
   - [ ] Update page titles from "TUTE Claiming" to "Election Voting"
   - [ ] Remove redundant wallet connection step (World App handles this)
   - [ ] Clean up component names and descriptions
   - [ ] Update README.md to reflect Election app purpose
2. **UI Polish**: Drag-and-drop could be enhanced with better visual feedback
3. **Error Handling**: Need better error messages for contract interactions
4. **Loading States**: Improve loading indicators during blockchain operations

## üìã Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours)

1. ‚úÖ **Add Initial Candidates to Contract**
   - [x] Check if candidates were added during deployment
   - [x] Create script to add candidates if missing
   - [x] Add 4 test candidates: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Wilson

## üìù Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ **What's Working**
- Smart contract deployed and functional with 4 candidates
- Frontend loads candidates correctly from contract
- Basic UI components built (CandidateList, CandidateRanking, VoteButton)
- Development server running at localhost:3000
- Contract integration tests passing
- **Fixed infinite loop errors** - App runs smoothly without React warnings
- **Streamlined authentication** - Removed redundant wallet connection UI
- **Complete election branding** - All TUTE references replaced with election terminology
- **Server-side debug monitoring** - Real-time monitoring at `/debug-logs` with auto-refresh
- **Bottom navigation with tabs** - Clean mobile-first UI with Candidates and My Ranking tabs

### ‚ùå **Remaining Issues**
- **Bottom Navigation Loading Issue**: Candidates tab shows spinning loading indefinitely while Ranking tab works correctly
  - CandidatesTab receives loading=true and never changes to false
  - Hidden CandidateList component loads data successfully (debug shows candidatesCount: 4)
  - handleCandidatesLoaded callback is called but candidatesLoading state not updating properly
  - Need to investigate state management between hidden CandidateList and visible CandidatesTab
- Need to verify World ID verification works with the deployed contract
- Drag-and-drop interface needs better mobile support
- Test processes hanging during Hardhat test execution (needs investigation)

### üîß **Technical Details**
- Contract address: `0x53c9a3D5B28593734d6945Fb8F54C9f3dDb48fC7`
- Network: worldchain-sepolia (Chain ID: 4801)
- World ID App ID: `app_10719845a0977ef63ebe8eb9edb890ad`
- Using pnpm for package management
- Following World Mini App standards and components

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can connect wallet and verify with World ID
- [ ] Users can see list of candidates from smart contract
- [ ] Users can drag-and-drop to rank candidates
- [ ] Users can submit votes that are recorded on-chain
- [ ] Users see confirmation after voting
- [ ] Users cannot vote twice
- [ ] App works on mobile devices in World App

## üîÑ Development Workflow

- Use `pnpm dev` to run the development server
- Test in World App simulator or actual World App
- Check browser console for any React warnings
- Use the debug panel (bottom right) to monitor app state
- **IMPORTANT**: Regularly commit AND push changes as you work - don't wait for completion, just keep going but commit frequently

### üìã **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Plan**: For every feature/task, first add detailed sub-tasks to TODO.md
2. **List**: Create a bulleted list of specific implementation steps
3. **Implement**: Work through each step systematically
4. **Commit**: Commit and push after completing each major step
5. **Update TODO**: Mark completed items and add any new discoveries
