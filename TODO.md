# Election Mini App - Development TODO

## 🎯 Project Overview

Election voting system where users can:
1. View candidates from a smart contract
2. Rank candidates in order of preference
3. Submit ranked votes using World ID verification

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Smart Contract
- **ElectionManager.sol** deployed to worldchain-sepolia: `0x53c9a3D5B28593734d6945Fb8F54C9f3dDb48fC7`
- Manages candidates and ranked voting with World ID verification
- 4 test candidates: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Wilson

### Frontend Components
- **Bottom Navigation**: Two-tab interface (Candidates / My Ranking)
- **CandidatesTab**: Displays candidate list from contract
- **RankingTab**: Drag-and-drop interface for ranking candidates
- **World ID Integration**: Verification before voting access
- **Debug Monitoring**: Server-side logging with `/api/debug` endpoint (UI hidden)

### Key Features Completed
- ✅ Smart contract deployed and functional
- ✅ Candidate loading from blockchain
- ✅ Bottom navigation with tab switching
- ✅ World ID verification flow
- ✅ Debug monitoring system
- ✅ Clean election branding (removed TUTE references)
