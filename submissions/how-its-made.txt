ARCHITECTURE & IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------------

Smart Contract Design:

The core voting contract implements a sophisticated ranked-choice voting system with World ID verification. Each vote is stored as an encrypted ranking array, with the World ID nullifier hash ensuring one-vote-per-person while maintaining privacy.

Ranking Algorithm:

Using pair-ranked based method for determining winners, which involves:

1. Creating pairwise comparison matrices between all candidates
2. Calculating the strength of victory for each pairing
3. Sorting and locking in the strongest victories first
4. Avoiding cycles to determine the final ranking

Mobile-First UX:

The interface was specifically designed for the World App environment with:

- Touch-optimized drag-and-drop for ranking candidates
- Progressive disclosure of complex voting options
- Real-time validation and feedback
- Offline-capable design for areas with poor connectivity

Security Considerations:

- All votes are cryptographically signed and verified
- World ID prevents sybil attacks while preserving anonymity
- Smart contract logic prevents double voting and tampering
- Frontend validation with backend verification for all user inputs

NOTABLE TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
------------------------------

World App Integration:

Deep integration with MiniKit allows for seamless user experience within the World App ecosystem, including automatic wallet connection and streamlined World ID verification.

By combining cutting-edge voting theory with modern blockchain technology and mobile-first design, this project represents a significant advancement in digital democracy tools.
