Simple ranked-choice voting World Mini App. It showcases a new paradigm for voting systems to address fundamental flaws in our democratic processes.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY
------------------

The system enables:

1. Election Creation and Management: Authorized users can create new elections with custom candidates, voting periods, and specific World ID verification requirements.

2. Ranked-Choice Voting: Voters can rank candidates in order of preference, including support for equal rankings (ties), providing a more nuanced expression of voter preferences than traditional single-choice voting.

3. World ID Verification: Each vote requires World ID verification, ensuring one-person-one-vote integrity while maintaining voter privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.

4. On-Chain Vote Recording: All votes are recorded on World Chain, providing transparency and immutability while preventing tampering.

5. Tideman/Condorcet Winner Calculation: The system uses advanced voting theory algorithms to determine winners based on pairwise comparisons between candidates, resulting in outcomes that better represent voter preferences.

WHY IT MATTERS
--------------

Existing electoral systems are fundamentally flawed, resulting in undemocratic outcomes where people are neither are nor feel well represented. These systems insidiously encourage and reward bad behavior from politicians, undermining the very foundations of society.

The Core Problem:

Current voting systems force artificial compromises that distort democratic will:

- Strategic Voting: Voters must choose between their preferred candidate and "electability"
- Polarization: Binary choices amplify division and eliminate nuanced positions  
- Unrepresentative Winners: Candidates can win without broad support due to vote splitting
- Perverse Incentives: Politicians are rewarded for attacking opponents rather than building consensus
- Voter Disillusionment: People lose faith when the system consistently fails to reflect their values

The Alternative:

This project implements cutting-edge voting methodology to resolve fundamental compromises plaguing all well-known electoral systems. Rather than debating which flawed system is "least bad," we demonstrate a profoundly superior approach that:

- Eliminates Strategic Voting: Voters can always vote their true preferences without fear of "wasting" their vote
- Rewards Consensus-Building: Politicians benefit from being broadly acceptable, not just intensely supported by a narrow base
- Ensures Democratic Legitimacy: Winners have genuine majority support through sophisticated preference aggregation
- Reduces Polarization: The system naturally favors candidates who can bridge divides

The Mission:

While this won't immediately fix democracy, it makes a demonstrably better voting system conveniently available to all. The goal is threefold: provide immediate utility for organizations needing better decision-making tools, demonstrate how superior systems work in practice, and spread awareness that far better alternatives exist. By changing the dialogue from "which compromise should we accept?" to "why accept compromises at all?", we can catalyze broader electoral reform.

Research Foundation:

This project draws from original research on voting systems and collaboration with members of multiple organizations campaigning for electoral reform in the UK. While these groups may not be specifically interested in blockchain technology, there is widespread recognition of the need for and appetite for better voting systems across the democratic reform community.

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
